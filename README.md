This project is a hands-on learning implementation focused on mastering TanStack Query for modern React applications.
It demonstrates how to efficiently fetch, cache, synchronize, and update server data without relying on traditional global state management.

The project explores core TanStack concepts such as query caching, background refetching, loading & error states, pagination, and mutation handling.
It highlights how TanStack Query improves performance, simplifies API logic, and reduces unnecessary re-renders.

Built using React + Vite, the project follows clean folder structure and best practices for scalable frontend development.
The goal of this repository is learning by building, not production complexity.
